# Anas Shaikh 
### Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Anas!. I am a graduate in Computer Science . I have also taken Google advance data analytics course. I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience doing multiple projects, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data Analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

I am also exploring the field of Machine Learning.
